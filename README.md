InScribeSecureSMS
A very simple Android Application for sending, receiving, viewing a secure SMS encrypted using ECDHE-RSA2048-AES256. It is the final project for "EL5111 - Cryptography and Its Application" - Institut Teknologi Bandung

This is my first time building an Android application using Android Studio.
